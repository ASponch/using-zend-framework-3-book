# Using Zend Framework 3

*Using Zend Framework 3* is an open-source project whose ame is to develop a good beginner-friendly book on Zend Framework 3 (or shortly, ZF3). If you would like to read the latest published release of the book, please visit [this link](https://olegkrivtsov.github.io/using-zend-framework-3-book/html). If you find the book interesting, please do not hesitate to contribute (see below).

PHP code samples mentioned in the book can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zf3-book-samples). Sorry for bugs if you find them, so feel free to [report issues in the code](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book/issues) if you don't understand why the code works as it works :) 

I also run another [open-source project](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/zf3-api-reference) whose goal is to develop a good ZF3 components & class reference.

## Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to make this book better:

  * If you want to report a typo or a mistake in the text, or found a mistake in an image referenced in the book text, you can do this on the [Issues](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book/issues) page. 
  * If you found a bug in some sample PHP code in the book text, please feel free to report it too.
  * If you would like translate existing chapters from English to your home language and contribute your work via a pull request, please see below for additional instructions. Your help is highly appreciated!
  * If you would like to fix a mistake in an image yourself, the PNG images referenced in the Markdown files are stored inside the *manuscript/en/images* directory, their corresponding SVG (or GraphML) sources are in *misc*. For editing SVGs, you can use the [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/ru/download/) editor. For editing the `.graphml` diagrams, please use [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

### Advice for Translators
  
The book text uses the Markdown format, particularly its [Leanpub flavor](https://leanpub.com/help/manual). 
  
For modifying the Markdown source of the book, please first make a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of this repository. 

Then use the [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) text editor to edit the manuscript files. Notepad++ allows
to avoid problems with character encoding (UTF-8 encoding is used). Please ensure that you use 4 spaces instead of tabs.  

When you are translating, please note there is no need to translate the *manuscript/en/acknownledgments.txt* file. This is just because I don't want to maintain its multiple copies. 

To generate the book HTML, use the [OpenBook](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/openbook) tool. Before committing your changes please ensure you fixed all (where possible) errors/warnings reported by the tool.

Names of contributors will be carefully listed under the *Acknowledgments* section of the book.
