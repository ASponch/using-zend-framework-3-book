<h1 id="intro">1. Introduction to Zend Framework 3</h1>
<p>In this chapter you will learn about Zend Framework 3, its main principles and components.</p>
<h2 id="header-6">1.1. What is Zend Framework 3?</h2>
<p>PHP is a popular website development language. However, writing
web-sites in pure PHP is difficult. If you write a web application in PHP, you have to organize
your code in some way, collect and validate user input, 
implement support of user access control, manage database, test your code and so on. As your site grows in size, it becomes
more and more difficult to develop the code in such manner. Moreover, when you
switch to the development of a new site, you will notice that a large portion of the code you have already
written for the old website can be used again with small modifications. This code can be separated
in a library. This is how frameworks appeared.</p>
<p>A framework is some kind of a library, a piece of software (also written in PHP)
providing web developers with code base and consistent standardized ways of creating
web applications. </p>
<p>Zend Framework 3 is a free and open-source PHP framework. 
Its development is guided (and sponsored) by Zend Technologies, who is also known as the vendor of the PHP 
language. The first version (Zend Framework 1) was released in 2007; Zend Framework 2, the second version of this software, 
was released in September 2012. Zend Framework 3 (or shortly ZF3) was released in June 2016.</p>
<p>Zend Framework 3 provides you with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop your web site much faster than when you write it in pure PHP. ZF3 provides
many components that can be used as a code base for creating your site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Easier cooperation with other members of your site building team. Model-View-Controller
pattern used by ZF3 allows to separate business logic and presentation layer of your
website, making its structure consistent and maintainable. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Scale your web site with the concept of modules. ZF3 uses the term <em>module</em>,
allowing to separate decoupled site parts, thus allowing to reuse models, views,
controllers and assets of your web-site in other works.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accessing database in an object-oriented way. Instead of directly interacting with the database 
using SQL queries, you can use Doctrine Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to manage the 
structure and relationships between your data. With Doctrine you map your database
table to a PHP class (also called an <em>entity</em> class) and a row from that table is
mapped to an instance of that class. Doctrine allows to abstract of database type 
and make code easier to understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write secure web sites with ZF3-provided components like
form input filters and validators, HTML output escapers and cryptography algorithms,
human check (Captcha) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) form elements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-7">1.2. License</h2>
<p>Zend Framework 3 is licensed under BSD-like license, allowing you to use it in
both commercial and free applications. You can even modify the library code and release
it under another name. The only thing you cannot do is to remove the copyright notice
from the code. If you use Zend Framework 3, it is also recommended that you mention
about it in your site's documentation or on About page.</p>
<p>Below, the Zend Framework 3 license text is presented. </p>

<h2 id="header-8">1.3. User Support</h2>
<p>Support is an important thing to consider when deciding whether to use
the framework as the base for your web site or not. Support includes well 
written documentation, webinars, community forums
and (optionally) commercial support services, like trainings and 
certification programs.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Documentation</em>. Documentation for Zend Framework is located by <a href="http://framework.zend.com/learn/">this address</a>.
It includes beginner's tutorial, programmers manual, and API reference 
(API stands for Application Programming Interface).</p>
<p><em>Community Forums</em>. Zend Framework has dedicated user groups all over the world.
The list of groups can be found on <a href="http://framework.zend.com/participate/user-groups">this page</a>.</p>
<p><em>Webinars</em> are video tutorials covering various Zend Framework features. Complete list of webinars
can be found by <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/resources/webinars/framework">this link</a>.</p>
<p><em>Training Classes</em> with live instructors can be accessed by 
<a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/training/course-catalog/zend-framework-2">this link</a>.
Here you can learn Zend Framework by doing exercises, 
mini-projects and developing real code. </p>
<p><em>Certification Program</em>. Allows you to become a Zend Certified Engineer (ZCE),
thus making it easier to improve your skills as an architect and to find a job in a 
competitive PHP job market. </p>
<h2 id="header-9">1.4. Framework Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code of Zend Framework 3 is stored in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/zendframework">repositories</a>. 
There is a separate repository per each ZF3 component. </p>
<blockquote class="notquote information" data-type="information"><p> In most cases you won't need to get the code of Zend Framework 3 manually.
 Instead, you will install it with Composer dependency manager. We will
 become familiar with Composer later in a chapter called <a href="Zend_Skeleton_Application.html#skeleton">Zend Skeleton Application</a>. </p>
</blockquote><h2 id="header-10">1.5. Supported Operating Systems</h2>
<p>As any PHP web-site, ZF3-based web application can work on a Linux server and on any other operating system where PHP can 
run. For instance, for creating samples for this book, the author used Ubuntu Linux operating system.</p>
<p>If you do not know yet what OS to use for your web development, it is 
recommended for you to use Linux, because most server software operates on
Linux servers. You can refer to <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a> for some 
instructions on configuring your development environment.</p>
<h2 id="header-11">1.6. Server Requirements</h2>
<p>Zend Framework 3 requires that your server has PHP version 5.6 (or later)
installed. Note that this is a rather strict requirement. Not all cheap shared hostings 
and not all private servers have such a modern PHP version.</p>
<p>Moreover, the recommended way of installing ZF3 (and other components 
your app depends on) is using <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>.
This forces the need of shell access (SSH) to be able
to execute Composer command-line tool. Some web hostings provide FTP access only, so
you won't be able to install a ZF3-based web app on such servers the usual way.</p>
<p>ZF3 utilizes URL rewriting extension for redirecting web-users to
entry script of your site (you have to enable Apache's <code>mod_rewrite</code> module.) 
You may also need to install some PHP extensions, like <code>xdebug</code> or <code>memcached</code>. 
This can be a difficulty when using a shared web hosting 
and requires that you have admin rights on your server.</p>
<p>So, if you are planning to use ZF3 on a shared web hosting, think twice.
The best server to install ZF3 on is a server with the latest version of
PHP and with shell access to be able to execute Composer and install PHP extensions.</p>
<p>If your company manages its own server infrastructure and can afford
upgrading PHP version to the latest one, you can install ZF3 on your private server. </p>
<p>An acceptable alternative is installing a ZF3-based web application to a 
cloud-based hosting service, like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>. 
Amazon provides Linux server instances as a part of EC2 service. EC2 is rather
cheap, and it provides a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">free usage tier</a> letting 
you try it for free for one year.</p>
<h2 id="header-12">1.7. Security</h2>
<p>Zend Framework 3 follows best practices to provide you with a secure code base
for your web sites. ZF3 creators release security bug fixes on a regular basis. You
can incorporate those fixes with a single command through Composer dependency 
manager.</p>
<p>ZF3 provides the following features allowing to make your web site secure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Routing</em> allows to define strict rules on how an acceptable page URL should look like.
If a site user enters an invalid URL in a web browser's navigation bar,
he/she is automatically redirected to an error page.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Access control lists</em> and <em>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</em> allow to
define flexible rules for granting or denying access to certain resources of 
your web site. For example, an anonymous user would have access to your index
page only, authenticated users would have access to their profile page, and
the administrator user would have access to site management panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Form validators and filters</em> ensure that no unwanted data is collected
through web forms. Filters, for example, allow to trim strings or strip HTML tags.
Validators are used to check that the data that had been submitted through a form 
conforms to certain rules. For example, E-mail validator checks that an E-mail field 
contains valid E-mail address, and if not, raises an error forcing the site user to correct 
the input error.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Captcha</em> and <em>CSRF</em> (Cross-Site Request Forgery) form elements are used for human checks
and hacker attack prevention, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Escaper</em> component allows to strip unwanted HTML tags from data outputted to site pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Cryptography support</em> allows you to store your sensitive data (e.g. credentials) encrypted with
strong crypo algorithms that are difficult to hack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-13">1.8. Performance</h2>
<p>ZF3 provides the following features to ensure its performance is acceptable: </p>
<p><em>Lazy class autoloading.</em> Classes are loaded once needed. 
You don't have to write <code>require_once</code> for each class
you want to load. Instead, the framework automatically discovers your classes 
using the <em>autoloader</em> feature.</p>
<p><em>Efficient service and plugin loading.</em> In ZF3, classes are instantiated
only when they really need to. This is achieved through service manager 
(the central repository for services of your application).</p>
<p><em>Support of caching.</em> PHP has several caching extensions (like Memcached) that
can be used to speed-up ZF3-based websites. Caching saves frequently 
used data to memory to speed-up data retrieval. </p>
<h2 id="header-14">1.9. Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Zend Framework 3 creators are big fans of various design patterns. Although
you don't have to understand patterns to read this book, this section is intended
to give you an idea of what design patterns ZF3 is based on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern</em>. Model-View-Controller pattern is used in all modern PHP
frameworks. In an MVC-application you separate your code into three categories:
models (your business logic go here), views (your presentation goes here) and
controllers (code responsible for interaction with user goes here). This is also 
called <em>the separation of concerns</em>. With MVC, you can <em>reuse</em> your components
in a different project. It is also easy to substitute any part
of this triad. For example, you can easily replace a view with another one, without
changing your business logic. </p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Domain Driven Design (DDD) pattern</em> In Zend Framework 3, by convention, you will have model 
layer further splitted into <em>entities</em> (classes mapped on database tables), 
<em>repositories</em> (classes used to retrieve entities from database),
<em>value objects</em> (model classes not having identity),
<em>services</em> (classes responsible for business logic).<br />
Additionally, you will have <em>forms</em> (model classes responsible for collecting user input),
view helpers (reusable plugin classes intended for rendering stuff) and others.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Aspect Oriented Design pattern.</em> In ZF3, everything is event-driven.
When a site user requests a page, an <em>event</em> is generated (triggered). A listener (or observer) can
catch event and do something with it. For example, <code>Router</code> component
parses the URL and determines what controller class to call. When the event finally reaches the page
renderer, an HTTP response is generated and the user sees the web page.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Singleton pattern.</em> In ZF3, there is the service manager object which is the centralized
registry of all services available in the application. Each service exists in a single
instance only. </p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Strategy pattern.</em> A strategy is
just a class encapsulating some algorithm. And you can use different algorithms based on 
some condition. For example, the page renderer has several rendering strategies,
making it possible to render web pages differently
(the renderer can generate an HTML page, a JSON response, an RSS feed etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Adapter pattern.</em> Adapters allow to adapt a generic class to concrete use case.
For example, <code>Db</code> component provides access to database in a generic way. 
Internally, it uses adapters for each supported database (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and so on.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Factory pattern.</em> You can create an instance of a class using the <code>new</code> operator. Or you can create it
with a factory. A factory is just a class encapsulating creation of other objects. 
Factories are useful, because they simplify dependency injection. This
simplifies the testing of your model and controller classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-15">1.10. Main ZF3 Components</h2>
<p>ZF3 developers believe that the framework should be a set of decoupled
components with minimum dependencies on each other. This is how ZF3 is 
organized. </p>
<p>The idea was to let you use some selected ZF3 components alone,
even if you write your site with another framework. This becomes
even easier, keeping in mind that each component of ZF3 is a Composer-installable
package, so you can easily install any ZF3-component together with its dependencies through a single command.</p>
<p>There are several "main" ZF3 components that are used (either explicitly or implicitly) 
in almost any web application: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Zend\EventManager</code> component allows to send events and register listeners to react to them. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\ModuleManager</code> In ZF3, every application consists of modules and this component contains
 module loading functionality.                                                  </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>  This is the centralized registry of all services available in the application, 
 making it possible to access services from any point of the web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\Http</code> provides an easy interface for performing Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
requests.                              </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\Mvc</code> Support of Model-View-Controller pattern and separation of business logic from 
presentation. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\View</code> Provides a system of helpers, output filters, and variable escaping. Used in 
presentation layer.                      </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\Form</code> Web form data collection, filtering, validation and rendering.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\InputFilter</code> Provides an ability to define form data validation rules. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\Filter</code> Provides a set of commonly used data filters, like string trimmer. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Zend\Validator</code> Provides a set of commonly used validators.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="header-16">1.11. Differences with Zend Framework 2</h2>
<p>For readers who have an experience in Zend Framework 2, in this section we'll
give some information on what has changed in Zend Framework 3.</p>
<p>Below, the main technical differences between ZF2 and ZF3 are presented:</p>
<h3 id="header-17">1.11.1. Backwards Compatibility</h3>
<p>ZF3 is an evolutionary release, so backwards compatibility is preserved in most cases. However,
some migration work still has to be done if you used <code>ServiceManagerAwareInterface</code> across your
code (which you probably did). In ZF3, this interface has been removed, and now all dependencies must be injected through
factories. So, you'll have to create factories for all your controllers, services, view helpers and
controller plugins. </p>
<h3 id="header-18">1.11.2. Components</h3>
<p>In ZF2, components were stored in a single repository named <code>zendframework/zf2</code>.
In ZF3, components are stored in GIT repositories, one repository per component (for example, 
<code>zendframework/zend-mvc</code>, <code>zendframework/zend-servicemanager</code>, <code>zendframework/zend-form</code>, etc). 
This allows to develop and release components
independently of each other.</p>
<p>Components are even more decoupled than before and have minimum dependencies on each other. <code>Mvc</code> component
has been splitted into several ones. For example, routing functionality has been moved to new <code>Router</code> component.</p>
<p>You are now recommended to specify individual component names your app depends on in <code>composer.json</code>, 
although it is still possible to depend on <code>zendframework/zendframework</code> package, which is a meta package 
installing <em>all</em> available components.</p>
<h3 id="header-19">1.11.3. Component Installer</h3>
<p>In ZF3, a special Composer plugin called <em>component installer</em> was introduced. It allows to install 
components as ZF modules. It injects information about the component into application configuration
file.</p>
<h3 id="header-20">1.11.4. ServiceManager and EventManager Performance</h3>
<p>ZF3 developers did a great job improving performance of <code>ServiceManager</code> and <code>EventManager</code> components.
They are now about several times faster than before. The disadvantage is that you now have to do some migration
work to use the new functionality. Controller and service names are now recommended to utilize
the PHP 5.5 feature called <code>::class</code>. For example, if previously you registered your controller as <code>Application\Controller\Index</code>,
now you will register it as <code>IndexController::class</code>. If previously you registered service names as you wished,
now you are recommended to do that using <code>ServiceClassName::class</code>. Read the documentation for <code>Mvc</code>
component for additional information.</p>
<h3 id="header-21">1.11.5. PSR-4</h3>
<p>In ZF2, the recommended directory structure was PSR-0, while in ZF3 it is PSR-4. This requires some
(small) migration work.</p>
<h3 id="header-22">1.11.6. Middleware</h3>
<p>Zend thinks that the future of PHP is in middleware. "Middleware is, quite simply, code sitting between 
an incoming HTTP request, and the outgoing HTTP response." Now you can register a middleware listener
in an MVC application. </p>
<h3 id="header-23">1.11.7. Focus on Documentation</h3>
<p>Now each component repository contains its own documentation. Documentation is now in Markdown format 
and has become better designed.  </p>
<h2 id="header-24">1.12. Summary</h2>
<p>A PHP framework is a library, giving you the code base and defining consistent ways of creating
web applications. Zend Framework 3 is a modern web development framework created by Zend Technologies,
the vendor of PHP language. It provides the developers
with outstanding capabilities for building scalable and secure web sites. ZF3 is licensed under BSD-like
license and can be used for free in both commercial and open-source applications.</p>
